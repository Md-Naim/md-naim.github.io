      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate with a strong focus on robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent embedded technologies. My academic and project work emphasizes the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to practical robotic and IoT systems.

        I currently serve as Advisor of the SMUCT Robotics & IoT Community and was previously Vice President of RoboSUST, contributing to projects and initiatives that integrate software, AI, and hardware design.

        My research interests include robot operating systems (ROS), computer vision, embedded systems, battery management, and hardware prototyping, with the goal of bridging the gap between intelligent algorithms and hardware implementation.

        I am open to research collaborations, technical projects, and professional engagements in the fields of robotics and intelligent systems.
